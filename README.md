A game consisting of a rectangular grid with random integers between 0 - 9
was designed. Numbers represent the time spent in each cell. An agent starts at the upperleft
corner of the grid and must reach the lower-right corner of the grid as fast as possible.
For comparison, 3 different algorithms were implemented to solve the game, a first baseline
algorithm with a naïve approach, Dijkstra’s algorithm and Ant colony optimization algorithm.
